The first goal of this project is to Simulate an Action Potential. This involves:
  1. An in-depth study of a pre-synaptic neuron, neuron, and the post-synaptic neuron.
  2. Creating an object model for component involved. 
  3. Making sure each component is flexible enough to be extended.
  4. Defining a way fo each of the components to communicate.
  5. Implememnting the functionality of each component.
  6. Extensive Unit Testing for each individual component.
  7. Extensive integration of necessaryts in the pre/neuron/post synaptic enruson.
  
After the first goal, our second goal is to to:
  1. Identify all sources where we can download appropriate datasets, like OpenMRI
  2. Understand the relevancy of each data set.
  3. Parse the data from each of these datasets into a common format.
  4. Create our own proprietary format that read eacj pf these data sets.
  5. Interleave each all of the relevant events from each data file into s single unified data set.
  6. Expose each event as a common event-type to the rest of the sysstem.
  7. Extensve Unit Testing for each steps.
  8. Extensve Integration Testing both with this sub-system and for each component above.
  9. Figure out how/where to store the output.

After the second goal, our third step is to b=to:
  1. Create a simulator that can interprets our results from the second step.
  2. Figure out what these mean
  3. Store the results from this backtest so we can mine it with differ

Other::
  1. Study up on Neuroscience, Biology, and Chemistry.
  2. Understand the role of known of known neurotransmitters.
