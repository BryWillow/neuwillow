### <u>NeuWillow Overview</u>
***
NeuWillow is a [Computational Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) research project. The project gets its name "Neu" for [neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron), and "Willow" for the tree-like structure of [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) connections.

This project zooms in on regions of the brain impacted by [Generalized Epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy) and [Dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia). Furthermore, on comorbid mental illnesses, including [Major Depressive Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) and [Panic Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_disorder).

That's ***a lot***. But there are some very specific questions this project aims to understand, through the use of:
- [Functional magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging) (fMRI).
- [Electroencephalography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) (EEG).
- [Magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) (MRI).
- [Neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) excitability, or lack thereof. 
- [OpenfMRI](https://openfmri.org) and [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org) where scientists have graciously shared their research.
- [The NeuWillow Model](https://github.com/BryWillow/neuwillow) that stitches neuron and brain activity, and all of the above together. <br><br>
