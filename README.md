#### <u>The Name</u>
***
NeuWillow is a [Computational Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) research project. The project gets its name from combining the words [neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) and [willow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow), as in the tree. The willow tree has an intricate branch structure, which, to me, resembles [dendrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite). There is much [symbolism](https://www.betterplaceforests.com/blog/willow-tree-symbolism/) surrounding the willow tree. Specifically, [sorrow, resilience, and rebirth](https://medium.com/@heningeralexander/willow-tree-78b1c71d4275). I liken these qualities, metaphorically speaking, to the human brain.

#### <u>Causes and Comorbidities</u>
***
This project zooms in on [Generalized Epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy). Most epilepsies are[idiopathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_disease)[1], and this project will place most emphasis in this category. Note that these types of epilepsies are always [under research](https://www.cureepilepsy.org).  

We think we know today the primary causes of idiopathic epilepsies to be:
- [Genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics)[2].
- [Malfunctioning Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_brain_network)[3].
- [Structural Brain Abnormalities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/brain-abnormalities)[4].
- [Traumatic Brain Injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury)[5].
 
and its most common comorbidities to be:

- [Anxiety Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder)[6]: including [Generalized(GAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder)[7], [Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_disorder)[8], and [Social(SAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder)[9].
- [Depressive Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood))[10]: including [Major Depressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder)[11], [Persistent](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/persistent-depressive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20350929)[10], and [Bipolar I/II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) (Controversial)[12].
- [Neurodegenerative Diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegenerative_disease)[13]: including [Dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia)[14] and [Alzheimer's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease)[15].

### <u>Neurons</u>
***
[Neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) are the fundamental units of the [Central Nervous System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system), which is the focus of this project. A neuron is an [excitable nerve cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential#Cell_excitability) that is part of a larger network. The anatomy of a neuron, and all of its structures, is quite complex. _**However**_, each structure, relevant to this project, is outlined in the _**[anatomy](https://github.com/BryWillow/neuwillow/wiki/Anatomy:-Neuron)**_ section of the **[NeuWillow Wiki](https://github.com/BryWillow/neuwillow/wiki)**. The brain is known to have around 86 billion neurons, and the spinal cord to have several million more.  Below is an image of a single neuron, with all of its structures clearly labeled:

### <u>Neuron Communication</u>
***

Neurons communicate with one another through , called [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron). A neuron has distinct parts, each with very different purposes. For further information, see the "Anatomy" pages in the Wiki. Below is an image of a single neuron, which points out all of the specific anatomy:  
  
  

#### <u>Neurotransmitter Communication</u>
***
More specifically, neurons communicate by releasing [neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter). This process is outlined in great detail in ihe Wiki. Below is an image of how neurotransmitters are passed from one neuron to the next:

The Wiki goes through this process in detail.
