#### <u>The Name</u>
***
NeuWillow is a [Computational Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) research project. The project gets its name from combining the words [neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) and [willow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow), as in the tree. The willow tree has an intricate branch structure, which, to me, resembles [dendrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite). There is much [symbolism](https://www.betterplaceforests.com/blog/willow-tree-symbolism/) surrounding the willow tree. Specifically, [sorrow, resilience, and rebirth](https://medium.com/@heningeralexander/willow-tree-78b1c71d4275). I liken these qualities, metaphorically speaking, to the human brain.

#### <u>Causes and Comorbidities</u>
***
This project zooms in on [Generalized Epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy). Most epilepsies are[idiopathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_disease)[1], and this project will place most emphasis in this category. Note that these types of epilepsies are always [under research](https://www.cureepilepsy.org).  

We think we know today the primary causes of idiopathic epilepsies to be:
- [Genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics)[2].
- [Malfunctioning Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_brain_network)[3].
- [Structural Brain Abnormalities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/brain-abnormalities)[4].
- [Traumatic Brain Injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury)[5].
 
and its most common comorbidities to be:

- [Anxiety Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder)[6]: including [Generalized(GAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder)[7], [Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_disorder)[8], and [Social(SAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder)[9].
- [Depressive Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood))[10]: including [Major Depressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder)[11], [Persistent](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/persistent-depressive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20350929)[10], and [Bipolar I/II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) (Controversial)[12].
- [Neurodegenerative Diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegenerative_disease)[13]: including [Dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia)[14] and [Alzheimer's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease)[15].

#### <u>Neurons Communication</u>
***
The brain communicates with itself through nerve cells, called [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron). A neuron has distinct parts, each with very different purposes. For further information, see the "Anatomy" pages in the Wiki. Below is an image of a neuron, which points out all of the specific anatomy:

More specifically, neurons communicate by releasing [neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter). This process is outlined in great detail in ihe Wiki. Below is an image of how neurotransmitters are passed from one neuron to the next:

The Wiki goes through this process in detail.
