# neuwillow
The goal of NeuWillow is to be able to interpret EEG (and perhaps in the future fMRI) datasets. Specifically, to begin with,
  1. Identifying specific conditions causing an ***Action Potential***.
  2. The relationship between concentraions of specific neurotransmitters and paths of ***Action Potentials***.
  3. Noting whether specific stimuli cause similar conditions among different age groups, races, genders.
