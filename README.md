### <u>Overvie</u>
***
NeuWillow is a [Computational Neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) research project. The project gets its name from combining the words [neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron) and [willow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow), as in the tree. The willow tree has an intricate branch structure, which, to me, resembles [dendrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite). There is much [symbolism](https://www.betterplaceforests.com/blog/willow-tree-symbolism/) surrounding the willow tree. Specifically, [sorrow, resilience, and rebirth](https://medium.com/@heningeralexander/willow-tree-78b1c71d4275). I liken these qualities, metaphorically speaking, to the human brain.

This project zooms in on [Generalized Epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_epilepsy). Much about this disease is still unknown and under research. This includes what we think are the primary causes:
- [Genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics)[1]
- [Malfunctioning Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-scale_brain_network)[^2]
- [Structural Brain Abnormalities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/brain-abnormalities)[^3]
- [Traumatic Brain Injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_brain_injury)[^4]
 
and its most common comorbidities:

- [Generalized Anxiety Disorder(GAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder), and [Panic Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_disorder), and [Social Anxiety Disorder(SAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder) 
- [Depressive Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder)
- [Neurodegenerative Diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegenerative_disease), including [Dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia) and [Alzheimer's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease)

That's ***a lot***. 

The primary treatment of generalized epilepsy is through [anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2730009/)[^12]. Often times, one [medication](https://github.com/BryWillow/neuwillow/wiki/Medications-Under-Study) is not effective. So, we try experimenting with [add-on medications](https://www.cureepilepsy.org/news/selection-of-anti-seizure-medications-for-first-add-on-use-a-consensus-paper/), or [combination therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy)[^8], We make educated guesses, titrate medications up/down, and wait for our bodies to adjust, but ultimately it's simply trial and error[^6]. Meanwhile, the side effects of these medications can be [devastating](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7343956/). It is not uncommon to experience[^9]: 
- Suicidal thoughts and cognitive impairment
- Blurry vision, dizziness, clumsiness, and an unsteady gait
- Sexual dysfunction and even miscarriages 
 
Consequently, many simply stop taking their medications, as the side effects are [too severe](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8075746/)[^10].  
There are still options if no medications work. Most, of which are outlined [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5068473/) [^11]. As always, check [Epilepsy.com](https://www.epilepsy.com) for the most up to date information.

In addition, many with epilepsy have pre-existing neurological and mental health conditions. So extra care needs to be taken such that a medication doesn't exacerbate another conditions. The [relationship](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7836659/)[^5] between epilepsy and dementia, and their treatment plans is one such example of [possible exacerbation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10073491/)[^6].

Moreover, after trying all of these combinations, [approximately 30%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10660394/)[^6] don't respond to any medications or treatment plans[^7]. This condition is called [uncontrolled epilepsy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14999166/)[^12]. 

I know that we can do better by continuing to spread awareness, educating ourselves, and doing more research. And the latter is a major goal of this project: not to find a cure, but to build a _**research platform**_ so that we can run _**tailored drug treatment simulations**_ before experimenting on people. 

### <u>Objectives</u>
***
- [Learn Anatomy Involved in Generalized Epilepsy](https://github.com/BryWillow/neuwillow/wiki/NeuWillow:-Anatomy)
- [Discover Relevant Datasets](https://github.com/BryWillow/neuwillow/wiki/Dataset-Sources)
- [Create the NeuWillow Model](https://github.com/BryWillow/neuwillow/wiki/NeuWillow:-Model-Creation)
- [Train the Model with Existing Datasets]()
- [Gather Statistics]()
- [Prioritize Model Parameter Configuration]()

### <u>Modalities</u>
***
Below are the tests we plan on using as part of the NeuWillow research project:
- [Functional magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging) (fMRI).
- [Electroencephalography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) (EEG).
- [Magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) (MRI).
<br><br>

### <u>Data Sources</u>
***
Below are the locations of the datasets we will be using.
- [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org): For datasets using the EEG and MRI modalities.
- [OpenfMRI](https://openfmri.org): Ror datasets using the fMRI modality.
<br>
These sites appear to be the industry standard and most comprehensive. The NIH has datasets as well, but the selection is much more limited, and the format does not appear to be standardized.
