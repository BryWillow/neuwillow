# neuwillow: neurological disorders and comorbidities


NeuWillow is a neuroscience-based research project that studies regions of the brain associated with neurological disorders and comorbid mental illnesses. The project gets its name "Neu" for neuron, and "Willow" for the tree-like structure of dendrite connections. It aims to model the regions of the brain impacted by these disorders and illnesses. To simulate dendrite activity, neurotransmitter receptors, action potentials, axons, synapses and general neuronal communication. And subsequently study the impact caused by the below AED and SSRI medications.

## Primary Areas of Study
- The <u>_**primary**_</u> neurological conditions we will study are Epilepsy and Dementia. Specifically, the relationship between these two conditions, and whether they exacerbate one another.
  - Epilepsy will be separated into the four recognized categories:
    - Focal
    - Generalized
    - Combined Focal and Generalized
    - Unknown
  - Dementia will be separated into the the five most common categories:
    - Alzheimer's Disease
    - Vascular Dementia
    - Lewy Body Dementia
    - Frontotemporal Dementia
    - Mixed Dementia 
* The <u>_**comorbid**_</u> mental illnesses we will study are Anxiety and Depression.
  - Anxiety will be limited to the three most common categories:
    - Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
    - Panic Disorder
    - Social Anxiety
  - Depression will be limited to three common categories:
    - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
    - Persistent Depressive Disorder
    - Bipolar Depression

## Objectives
  - Model regions of the brain impacted by the above neurological disorders and mental illnesses.
  - Create or use existing quantitative scales for measuring severity.
  - Gather relevant open-source data from EEG, MRI, fMRI, and other relevant tests
  - The NIH, OpenNeuro, and GitHub provide reputable, reliable datasets.
  - Read data in the industry-standard Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format.
  - Train the models based on data from these studies.
  - Start introducing classes of medication to the model.
  - Quantitatively measure impact and severity for each class of medication.
