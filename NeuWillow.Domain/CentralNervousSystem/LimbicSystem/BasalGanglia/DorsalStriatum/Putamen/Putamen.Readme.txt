The putamen and caudate nucleus together form the dorsal striatum. 
Through various pathways, the putamen is connected to the substantia nigra, 
the globus pallidus, the claustrum, and the thalamus, in addition to many regions of the cerebral cortex. 
A primary function of the putamen is to regulate movements at various stages such as in preparation and execution; 
and to influence various types of learning. It employs GABA, acetylcholine, and enkephalin 
to perform its functions. The putamen also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases, 
such as Parkinson's disease.
