https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudate_nucleus

The caudate nucleus is one of the structures that make up the corpus striatum, 
which is part of the basal ganglia in the human brain.
Although the caudate nucleus has long been associated with motor processes 
because of its relation to Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, 
it also plays important roles in nonmotor functions, such as procedural learning, 
associative learning, and inhibitory control of action.[5] The caudate is also 
one of the brain structures that compose the reward system, and it functions as part of the 
cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.
